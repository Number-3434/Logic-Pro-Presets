# Plug-in Settings

This contains all the plug-in presets I use in Logic Pro.

Note that some presets are for external plug-ins, which will need downloading.

All plug-in settings are <samp>.pst</samp> files.

## Using Presets

A preset is a copy of all the parameters (excluding Sidechain) of a plug-in.

All presets are stored as <samp>.pst</samp> files.

### Downloading Presets

## Default Preset

The plug-in is inserted with the default preset.

The default can be set, modified, or deleted.

### User Default

The "User Default" preset is automatically set on plug-in insertion.

When active, the preset name will show up as <samp>User Default</samp>.

#### Defining a Default Preset

You can define custom default presets using two methods:

1. Save as Default
   Click the <samp>Save as Default</samp> button to save as the default preset.
2. Custom Name
   You could manually save a preset as the default by naming it <samp>#default</samp>
   (This is used internally to store the default).

#### Clearing the Default Preset

You can clear the default preset by selecting the default (using <samp><kbd>Recall Default</kbd></samp>),
or by inserting a new plug-in, and then clicking <samp><kbd>Delete</kbd></samp>

### Factory Default

The [<samp>Factory Default</samp>] preset is labelled "<samp>Default Preset.pst</samp>"

> [!note]
> The [<samp>Factory Default</samp>] is not included, it has been added manually.

> [!tip]
> #### Obtaining the [<samp>Factory Default</samp>] Setting
>
> If you haven't yet defined a [<samp>User Default</samp>]
> setting, then the [<samp>Factory Default</samp>] is automatically applied on insertion.
>
> This happens even if the user has defined other presets.
>
> Else:
>
> 1. Load the [<samp>User Default</samp>] preset.
