# Plug-in Settings

This contains all the plug-in presets I use in Logic Pro.

Note that some presets are for external plug-ins, which will need downloading.

All plug-in settings are <samp>.pst</samp> files.

## Defaults

### User Default

### Factory Default

The factory default is labelled "<samp>Default Preset</samp>"

> [!tip]
> #### Obtaining the Factory Default Setting
> The factory default preset can be obtained by deleting the [User Default](#user-default).
