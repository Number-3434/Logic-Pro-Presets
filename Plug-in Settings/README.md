# Plug-in Settings

This contains all the plug-in presets I use in Logic Pro.

Note that some presets are for external plug-ins, which will need downloading.

All plug-in settings are <samp>.pst</samp> files.

## Defaults

### User Default

### Factory Default

The factory default is labelled "<samp>Default Preset</samp>"
