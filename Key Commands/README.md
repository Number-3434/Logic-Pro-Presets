# Logic-Pro-Presets - Key Commands

This contains the keybindings I've used in the past.

Currently, I'm only using [Custom Pro](Key%20Commands/Custom%20Pro).

The other keybindings are all legacy.

### Keybindings:
- <samp>[lpkc](Key%20Commands/lpkc) (legacy)</samp>
- <samp>[lpkc 2](Key%20Commands/lpkc%202) (legacy)</samp>
- <samp>[Custom Pro](Key%20Commands/Custom%20Pro) (I'm currently using this one)</samp>

> [!important]
> Each folder contains a <samp>.logikcs</samp> (Logic Pro Keybindings) file and a <samp>.txt</samp> (text) file.
>
> If you want to use the keybinding, download the <samp>.logikcs</samp> file.
>
> The <samp>.txt</samp> file is only included for human legibility, and shouldn't be used.
